# What is Windows Error Reporting

Windows Error Reporting (WER) is a feature of Microsoft Windows that provides crash reporting solutions. It was introduced with Windows XP and has been included in subsequent versions of Windows. The primary function of WER is to offer users the opportunity to send data about crashes and failures to Microsoft. When a program crashes or encounters a critical error, WER collects debug information, which includes information about the state of the program at the time of the crash.
