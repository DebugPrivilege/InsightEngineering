# What is Windows Error Reporting

Windows Error Reporting (WER) is a feature of Microsoft Windows that provides crash reporting solutions. It was introduced with Windows XP and has been included in subsequent versions of Windows. When a program crashes or encounters a critical error, WER collects debug information, which includes information about the state of the program at the time of the crash.

Here is an example of a log entry that is a record that **beacon.exe** experienced a problem, and Windows Error Reporting created a crash report
