# DISCLAIMER

I’ve always believed in reproducible analysis, so I used to include memory dumps and other files with each write-up so people could follow along. At the time I uploaded everything to MEGA, but I didn’t realize they would delete the data if I became inactive. Because of that, the links to those memory dumps no longer work.
