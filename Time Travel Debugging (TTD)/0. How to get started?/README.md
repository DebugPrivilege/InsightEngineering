# How to get started?

This section covers the steps to install all the necessary tools and set up your environment for using Time Travel Debugging and analyzing recordings.

## Getting Started with TTD

1. Install **WinDbg** and configure all the symbols if you haven't done it yet: https://github.com/DebugPrivilege/InsightEngineering/tree/main/Debugging%20101/Section%200%3A%20Start%20Here
2. Download the **TTD** command-line utility: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debuggercmds/time-travel-debugging-ttd-exe-command-line-util#when-to-use-the-ttdexe-command-line-utility
3. When you download **TTD**, the binaries will be stored in a directory under `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps`, such as `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.TimeTravelDebugging_1.11.429.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe`. It is recommended to copy the folder to a more convenient location and rename it, for example, to `ttd`.
